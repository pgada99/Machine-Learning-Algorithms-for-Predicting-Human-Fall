### This project was done in collaboration with Francesco Stampini, in fact, the latter is part of a series of projects completed during the Machine Learning course at the University of Paris-Saclay.

###  Machine-Learning-Algorithms-for-Predicting-Human-Fall
####  Abstract:
##### The aim of our study is to apply Machine Learning models and techinques on a given dataset containing anonymous, scaled data related to peopleâ€™s movement on a sensored carpet. Each observation is linked to a binary label, giving information on whether the observed subject has fallen or not. Our goal is therefore to classify these observations, in order to predict if the fall has taken place. For that matter, we compare models by computing their performance scores using a Stratified K-Fold technique; to do that, we first solve the issue of Imbalanced Classes and perform Feature Selection to reduce the dimensionality of the problem.
